# Lem-in-Visualizer

This is a visualizer bonus to compliment to Hive(42) project Lem_in.

## Lem_in

Lem_in is a project in the school Hive(42). You are given a file that will be read from the `STDIN`. The file will contain a map that must be parsed. This map contains a number of `ants`, a list of `rooms` along with their `coordinates`, comments indicating where the `start(source)` and `end(sink)` are, and finally the `links(edges)`.
